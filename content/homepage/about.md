## About me

I like to work on or think about C2 infrastructure, macOS, OSINT, physical 
security, foreign affairs.

I made [Venus](https://github.com/MythicAgents/venus), 
a payload for Mythic C2, to highlight the attack surface area of the popular 
Visual Studio Code editor. It installs (as an initial payload or as persistence after landing on a host) as a normal VS Code extension but provides cross-platform remote access.

To help myself and my team create and manage identities for red team operations, I made [Sockdrawer](https://sockdrawer.app), a web app-based alias identity manager. Others might find it useful, like OSINT collectors, journalists, and privacy-conscious people.

I also contribute to other open source projects like 
[Mythic](https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic), 
[HealthInspector](https://github.com/its-a-feature/HealthInspector), and 
[SwiftBelt](https://github.com/cedowens/SwiftBelt).
